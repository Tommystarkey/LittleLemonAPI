# LittleLemonAPI
This is an API project that i am learning from my "Introduction to Back End Development" Course on Coursera by META.

The purpose of this project is to help me learn how to use the Django Web Framework and build APIs. As a result, there are lots of comments that I use to keep notes about how the system works. Please forgive me if the comments are quite messy; they really help me understand some of the fundamental coding concepts and gain a deeper understanding of Django Web Architecture. I would really focus on cleaning up my comments for any code being pushed to a professional environment.
